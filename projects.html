                <p>I Developed a website called "The Dreamers" using HTML,the website<br> 
                    was developed to encourage young individuals potray thier art<br>
                    work online for viewers to see and appreciate and if liked they<br>
                    were able to purchase some of the art work via this website<br>
                    to support these young dreamers.</p>

              <p>In a recent project, I created a basic 3D model prototype for a consumer product.<br>
                Using entry-level 3D modeling software, I designed and sculpted a simplified representation of the product,<br>
                 focusing on its key features and overall form. While the model lacked intricate details,<br>
                 it served as an effective visual aid for concept validation and initial design exploration.<br>
                 The prototype enabled stakeholders to visualize the product's dimensions and proportions,<br>
                 providing valuable insights for further iteration and refinement.<br> 
                 This project demonstrated my ability to translate design concepts into tangible 3D representations,<br>
                 laying the groundwork for future development and refinement.</p>

                <li>HackVSIT 5.0, hosted at Vivekananda institute of Professional Studies (VIPS),  Organised by ACE, this event was designed
                     to promote creativity in coding, design, and innovation while providing a platform for technical skills and inspiring real - world solutions.
                     they Were all about collaboration, pushing boundaries, and inspiring real-world solutions.

                <br>
                <li>"TechAbhikriti" was an exhilarating hackathon designed to ignite innovation and showcase the prowess of budding tech enthusiasts.
                     This dynamic event provided a platform for participants to unleash their creativity, problem-solving skills, and technical expertise 
                     in a competitive yet collaborative environment.</li>
                     <br>
                <li>"Code rave" is an annual coding carnival organized in collaboration with Internwell SLIET.
                    This Hackathon's purpose was to immerse coding enthusiasts in a stimulating, inventive, 
                    and team-building competition by making us deal with real-world issues and find solutions. 
                    By challenging and motivating us to aim higher, think bigger, and work harder, 
                    Code Rave aims at pushing peeps to be their best. It was a chance to create a network,
                     as well as friendships, partnerships, and potential future project collaborations.
                      This was a 36 hour project based hackathon</li>
